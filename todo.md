Weight matrix shape = (number of neurons in current layer) × (number of neurons in previous layer)

Bias vector shape = (number of neurons in that layer) × 1







* __batch over__: every training example
* __mini-batch__: over a subset of training example
* __stochastic__: over only 1 traning example
